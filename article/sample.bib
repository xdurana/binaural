abstract = {UNLABELLED: Minimal hepatic encephalopathy (MHE) detection is difficult because of the unavailability of short screening tools. Therefore, MHE patients can remain undiagnosed and untreated. The aim of this study was to use a Stroop smartphone application (app) (EncephalApp\_Stroop) to screen for MHE. The app and standard psychometric tests (SPTs; 2 of 4 abnormal is MHE, gold standard), psychometric hepatic encephalopathy score (PHES), and inhibitory control tests (ICTs) were administered to patients with cirrhosis (with or without previous overt hepatic encephalopathy; OHE) and age-matched controls from two centers; a subset underwent retesting. A separate validation cohort was also recruited. Stroop has an "off" state with neutral stimuli and an "on" state with incongruent stimuli. Outcomes included time to complete five correct runs as well as number of trials needed in on (Ontime) and off (Offtime) states. Stroop results were compared between controls and patients with cirrhosis with or without OHE and those with or without MHE (using SPTs, ICTs, and PHES). Receiver operating characteristic analysis was performed to diagnose MHE in patients with cirrhosis with or without previous OHE. One hundred and twenty-five patients with cirrhosis (43 previous OHE) and 134 controls were included in the original cohort. App times were correlated with Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (Offtime: r = 0.57; Ontime: r = 0.61; P < 0.0001) and were worst in previous OHE patients, compared to the rest and controls. Stroop performance was also significantly impaired in those with MHE, compared to those without MHE, according to SPTs, ICTs, and PHES (all P < 0.0001). A cutoff of >274.9 seconds (Ontime plus Offtime) had an area under the curve of 0.89 in all patients and 0.84 in patients without previous OHE for MHE diagnosis using SPT as the gold standard. The validation cohort showed 78\% sensitivity and 90\% specificity with the >274.9-seconds Ontime plus Offtime cutoff. App result patterns were similar between the centers. Test-retest reliability in controls and those without previous OHE was good; a learning effect on Ontime in patients with cirrhosis without previous OHE was noted.

CONCLUSION: The Stroop smartphone app is a short, valid, and reliable tool for screening of MHE.},

@article{Davidson2013a,
abstract = {In psycholinguistic studies using error rates as a response measure, response times (RT) are most often analyzed independently of the error rate, although it is widely recognized that they are related. In this paper we present a mixed effects logistic regression model for the error rate that uses RT as a trial-level fixed- and random-effect regression input. Production data from a translation-recall experiment are analyzed as an example. Several model comparisons reveal that RT improves the fit of the regression model for the error rate. Two simulation studies then show how the mixed effects regression model can identify individual participants for whom (a) faster responses are more accurate, (b) faster responses are less accurate, or (c) there is no relation between speed and accuracy. These results show that this type of model can serve as a useful adjunct to traditional techniques, allowing psycholinguistic researchers to examine more closely the relationship between RT and accuracy in individual subjects and better account for the variability which may be present, as well as a preliminary step to more advanced RT-accuracy modeling.},

abstract = {The effect of outliers on reaction time analyses is evaluated. The first section assesses the power of different methods of minimizing the effect of outliers on analysis of variance (ANOVA) and makes recommendations about the use of transformations and cutoffs. The second section examines the effect of outliers and cutoffs on different measures of location, spread, and shape and concludes using quantitative examples that robust measures are much less affected by outliers and cutoffs than measures based on moments. The third section examines fitting explicit distribution functions as a way of recovering means and standard deviations and concludes that unless fitting the distribution function is used as a model of distribution shape, the method is probably not worth routine use.},

@article{VanZandt2000,
abstract = {Among the most valuable tools in behavioral science is statistically fitting mathematical models of cognition to data--response time distributions, in particular. However, techniques for fitting distributions very widely, and little is known about the efficacy of different techniques. In this article, we assess several fitting techniques by simulating six widely cited models of response time and using the fitting procedures to recover model parameters. The techniques include the maximization of likelihood and least squares fits of the theoretical distributions to different empirical estimates of the simulated distributions. A running example is used to illustrate the different estimation and fitting procedures. The simulation studies reveal that empirical density estimates are biased even for very large sample sizes. Some fitting techniques yield more accurate and less variable parameter estimates than do others. Methods that involve least squares fits to density estimates generally yield very poor parameter estimates.},
